        <div class="sectionh1">About Me.</div>
        <div class="sectionh2">I love to learn. It's been my main passion throughout my entire life.</div>
        <p>I would consider myself a very lucky child growing up. I had a wonderful father who loved to teach me many things, and would answer any questions I had for him. He took me: <b>fossil hunting</b>, taught me to <b>draw and paint</b>, took me to <b>hockey</b> and <b>soccer</b> games and practice for 10 years, and even got me into some <b>computer games and software</b> at a very young age. I am a lover of <b>science</b>, <b>technology</b>, <b>people</b>, and <b>nature</b>.</p>
        <p>When I was 7 years old, I started to teach myself how to play the <b>piano</b>. What inspired me? Well... no other than what <a href="https://reason.com/2018/12/11/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-greatest/" target=_blank/> many consider one of the best video games of all time </a>, the Nintendo 64 game <a href="images/LoZ_Rankings.jpg" target=_blank/>'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'.</a></p>
        <p>Ever since that early memory of learning to discover music and the piano, I've been enarmoured with teaching myself and learning new skills.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my free time developing new skills or expanding my knowledge from a wide variety of areas in life. Some of these areas include <b>digital technologies like:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Photoshop</b> and digital photo manipulation (since the age of 12)</li>
            <li><b>Animation</b> (since the age of 13)</li>
            <li><b>Programming</b> (since the age of 13 in an innocent way/ignorant way — I modified an old game engine called the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/" target=_blank>'Torque Game Engine'</a> for an obscure game demo called <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/games/realm-wars/zc1551" target=_blank>'Realm Wars'</a> which was written in C#; I had no actual formal knowledge of programming at all. I just tinkered and discovered for myself what things in the code did, and spent 100s of hours on my own creations)</li>
            <li><b>Video Editing</b> and running a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_6rS0_YWKywZ2ANsMHKFA" target=_blank>YouTube channel</a></li>
            <li><b>Music production - </b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-419673112" target=_blank>My track called 'Chips 'n Mulch'</a> (using Fruity loops)</li>
            <li><b>Audacity</b> and audio design/manipulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside the digital realm of computers, I have had many other hobbies as well; too many to remember them all over the years. Not too long ago I got into <b>bow making</b> too — despite never having any experience with archery before — and learned how to even fletch my own arrows. Here's a short video taken of me firing a home-made arrow (fashioned from a wooden dowel, and synthetic feathers) from one of my own bows named 'Dragon's Fire'.</p>
        <div id="videoframe">
            <a href="images/dragonsfire_large.jpg"><img src="images/dragonsfire.jpg" style="padding: 5px" alt="A bow I created by the name of Dragon's Fire, made with 1/2 inch furniture grade PVC, and an arrow that I had created and fletched by hand"/></a>

        </div>
        <p>I am incredibly excited to see what the future holds: what new skills I'll learn and develop, projects I'll complete, knowledge I'll acquire, and people I'll meet.</p>
